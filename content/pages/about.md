Welcome,

I am Yassine - Software Engineer and Tech entrepreneur.
I am passionate about web development, data science and building meaningful digital products.

I graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris - MSc Applied Mathematics & Data Science (Promotion Louis Bl√©riot).

These days, I am in charge of the tech and product team of Manatal.com - a software company I co-founded offering a solution to empower recruiters and headhunters (companies and recruitment agencies).

I am based out of Bangkok (Thailand), previously Paris (France) and originally I am from Rabat (Morocco). I can speak arabic, english and french fluently.

Here, I share my thoughts and my experiences.
